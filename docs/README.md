# Reading order
The documentation is very rough and I write it as new features come to mind. You could call it a _living documentation_.

To make sense for a new reader, the reading order is:

1. conveyer.md
2. application-structure.md
3. apis-overview.md
4. data-model.md
5. unit-overview.md
6. blog-resource-schema.md

# Notations
Some files have a ! or an x- in front of them. I use these notations to mark different states of the document. So far:

! - means the document needs review.

x - means the document will not be part of the documentation, is just for me to keep track of features I'm working on.
